    <h1>Javascript Intro</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Javascript was called LiveScript in earlier days, due to JAVA
        popularity, it changes to Javascript, it has nothing to do with JAVA.
      </li>
      <li>
        Js runs on browser to bring dynamic effects to the web page, like
        opening a modal in same page for brief info rather opening new page.
      </li>
      <li>
        browsers have their own Javascript engine to compile js, google chrome
        uses -V8 engine, firfox uses - spider monkey.
      </li>
      <li>V8 is very popular and used in Node Js as well.</li>
      <li>Javascript versions are called with prefix ES - Ecma Script</li>
      <li>ES5->ES6->ES2016->ES2017....ES2021</li>
      <li>
        ES6 was the version had lots of changes, that is why it is called modern
        javascript from ES6 onwards
      </li>
    </ul>
